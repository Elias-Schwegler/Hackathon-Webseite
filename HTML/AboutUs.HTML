            <div class="AboutUsText">Hello and welcome to Natural Resources. <br> <br> Right now we would like to share with you a little insight behind the scenes. <br> I personally the Creator of the Website and a passionate Beekeeper, am the son of two incredibly good naturopaths, one of course my mother, which studied Traditional Chinese Medicine and the other, my father, which practices his job for over 45 years, thus before it even really existed in Switzerland. <br>

              There is also my little sister and brother that help keep the whole idea sill going and thriving. They are helping on the fields, in the office and of course they try to improve and add ideas whatsoever.  <br><br>
              
              Minor problems that we faced were the shortage of time and personnel, which we over the years learned to overcome, but eventually it all added up and here we are.  <br><br>
              
              Our Promise to our customers.<br><br> We or Natural Resources will only provide you with the highest quality herbs and bee products, planted with love, treated with the most care and picked by hand. <br>All this not just because we want to sell off some stuff, but because we personally would want it the in the highest quality possible and to keep the beauty and diversity, which nature could offer and not some green deserts. <br>
              
              <br>With all this said, I hope you will enjoy our services and products.  <br><br>
